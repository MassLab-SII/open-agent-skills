The comment format is `[name:content]`, where:\n\n- `name` is the commenter's name\n- `content` is the revision note\n\n**Special Note:** If the name is \"All parties\", it represents a joint comment from all parties, which counts as one comment but does not count toward any individual's personal comment count.\n\n## Task\n\nYour task is to review these versions and identify all clauses that have been commented in **v5,6,7 (in folder legal_files/)**. Generate a file named `dispute_review.txt` in the main directory. In this file, list each commented clause on a separate line and indicate the number of comments for each clause in the format \"Clause number:number of comments\".

Below is the complete documentation.\n\n---\nname: file_organization\ndescription: File organization toolkit. Provides duplicate detection, file merging/splitting, pattern matching, text processing (like case conversion, word counting), and file classification by size or time.\n---\n\n# File Organization Skill\n\nThis skill provides file analysis, manipulation, and organization:\n\n1. **Duplicate detection**: Find and organize files with identical content\n2. **File merging**: Combine multiple small files into one\n3. **File splitting**: Split large files into smaller equal-sized parts\n4. **Pattern matching**: Find files containing specific substrings\n5. **Text transformation**: Convert files to uppercase and count words\n6. **Size classification**: Organize files by size thresholds\n7. **Time classification**: Organize files by creation time\n\n---\n\n## 1. Duplicate File Detection\n\nScans all files in a directory, identifies files with duplicate content, and moves them to a separate subdirectory.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Find and organize duplicate files (default directory name: 'duplicates')\npython find_duplicates.py /path/to/directory\n\n# Use a custom directory name for duplicates\npython find_duplicates.py /path/to/directory --duplicates-dir my_duplicates\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. File Merging\n\nIdentifies the N smallest .txt files, sorts them alphabetically, and merges their content into a single file.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Merge the 10 smallest .txt files (default)\npython merge_files.py /path/to/directory\n\n# Merge the 5 smallest files\npython merge_files.py /path/to/directory --count 5\n\n# Use a custom output filename\npython merge_files.py /path/to/directory --output merged_content.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. File Splitting\n\nSplits a large text file into multiple smaller files with equal character counts.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Split large_file.txt into 10 equal parts (default)\npython split_file.py /path/to/directory large_file.txt\n\n# Split into 5 parts\npython split_file.py /path/to/directory large_file.txt --parts 5\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Pattern Matching\n\nFinds all files that contain a substring of N or more characters that also appears in a reference file.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Find files with 30+ character matches (default)\npython pattern_matching.py /path/to/directory large_file.txt\n\n# Use a custom minimum length\npython pattern_matching.py /path/to/directory large_file.txt --min-length 50\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Text Transformation (Uppercase)\n\nConverts text files to uppercase and counts words in each file.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Convert specific files to uppercase\npython convert_uppercase.py /path/to/directory --files file_01.txt file_02.txt file_03.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. File Size Classification\n\nClassifies files into different subdirectories based on their file sizes.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Using default thresholds (300 and 700 bytes)\npython classify_files_by_size.py /path/to/directory\n\n# Custom thresholds\npython classify_files_by_size.py /path/to/directory --small 1024 --large 10240\n\n# Custom category names\npython classify_files_by_size.py /path/to/directory --small-category tiny --medium-category normal --large-category huge\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. File Time Classification\n\nClassifies files into MM/DD directory structure based on their creation time.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Classify files by creation time\npython classify_files_by_time.py /path/to/directory\n```\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the skill documentation above carefully\n2. Determine the appropriate command and parameters based on the user's task\n3. Output the command using the format specified in the system prompt (code block recommended)\n4. After receiving the results, provide a summary to the user\n\n**Remember:** You decide the command parameters based on the task requirements and the documentation above.\n",

Assuming the accuracy of the representations of the Purchasers in Section 3 of this Agreement and subject to the filings described in Section 2.6 below, the Shares will be issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws.
