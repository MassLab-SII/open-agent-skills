The comment format is `[name:content]`, where:\n\n- `name` is the commenter's name\n- `content` is the revision note\n\n**Special Note:** If the name is \"All parties\", it represents a joint comment from all parties, which counts as one comment but does not count toward any individual's personal comment count.\n\n### Task Description\n\n**Your task is to focus on clauses 4.6, 4.16, 6.8, and 6.16 in v5-9** to determine:\n\n1. Who first proposed the idea that eventually led to the final agreed solution\n2. In which version's comment it appeared\n\n**Important:** If the final solution was formed through multiple people's comments, count as the originator the person whose comment first provided the core motivation (or part of the idea) that shaped the final solution. The key is to identify who initially proposed the motivation for the final solution.\n\n### Output Requirements\n\n**File Name:** `tracing.csv` (must be placed in the main directory)\n\n**CSV Structure:**\n\n- **First row** (excluding the top-left cell): `4.6, 4.16, 6.8, 6.16`\n- **First column** (excluding the top-left cell): `version_number, name`\n- **Remaining cells:** Fill in the `version_number` (the version in which the final solution was first proposed, only write a number without any other things) and the `name` (the person who proposed it) for each clause\n\n\n**Environment Backup**: A backup of the test environment has been created at:\n`/Users/zhaoji/project/mcpmark/.mcpmark_backups/backup_filesystem_legal_document_solution_tracing_9375`\n\nPlease use this directory as your working directory.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Below is the complete documentation.\n\n---\nname: advanced-file-management\ndescription: Advanced file management tools. Includes batch folder creation, batch file moving, file listing, and HTML author extraction.\n---\n\n# Advanced File Management Skill\n\nThis skill provides tools for desktop file management:\n\n1. **Folder creation**: Create multiple folders under a target directory\n2. **Move files**: Move multiple files to a target directory\n3. **List all files**: Recursively list all files under a directory\n4. **Extract authors**: Extract authors from HTML papers\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Do not use other bash commands**: Do not attempt to use general bash commands or shell operations like cat, ls.\n- **Use relative paths**: Use paths relative to the working directory (e.g., `./folder/file.txt` or `folder/file.txt`).\n- **Do not create scripts**: Do not use `write_file` to create any scripts.\n\n\n## I. Skills\n\n### 1. Create Multiple Folders\n\nCreates multiple folders under a target directory.\n\n### Features \n\n- Creates multiple folders with specified names\n- Supports any number of folder names as arguments\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Create 3 folders\npython create_folders.py . folder1 folder2 folder3\n\n# Create folders with specific names\npython create_folders.py ./projects experiments learning personal\n```\n\n\n### 2. Move Multiple Files\n\nMove multiple files to a target directory in a single operation.\n\n### Features\n\n- Move multiple files at once\n- Supports files from different directories\n- Reports success and failure for each file\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Move 3 files to archive folder\npython move_files.py ./archive file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n\n# Move files from different directories\npython move_files.py ./backup ./data/log1.txt ./data/log2.txt ./temp/cache.dat\n```\n\n\n### 3. List All Files\n\nRecursively list all files under a given directory path. Useful for quickly understanding project directory structure.\n\n### Features\n\n- Recursively traverse all subdirectories\n- Option to exclude hidden files (like .DS_Store)\n- Output one file path per line, including both path and filename (relative to input directory)\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# List all files (excluding hidden)\npython list_all_files.py .\n\n# Include hidden files\npython list_all_files.py ./data --include-hidden\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Extract Authors\n\nExtract authors from all HTML papers in a directory using `<meta name=\"citation_author\">` tags.\n\n### Features\n\n- Automatically scan all HTML files in directory\n- Extract author names from citation_author meta tags\n- Support multiple authors per paper\n- Returns list of dicts with filename and authors\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Extract and print authors from all HTML files\npython extract_authors.py ./papers\n\n# Save to file\npython extract_authors.py ./papers --output authors.txt\n```\n\n---\n\n## II. Basic Tools (FileSystemTools)\n\nBelow are the basic tool functions. These are atomic operations for flexible combination.\n\n**Prefer Skills over Basic Tools**: When a task matches one of the Skills above (e.g., creating multiple folders), use the corresponding Skill instead of Basic Tools. Skills are more efficient because they can perform batch operations in a single call.\n\n**Prefer List All Files over list_directory/list_files**: When you need to list files in a directory, prefer using the `list_all_files.py` skill instead of `list_directory` or `list_files` basic tools. The skill provides recursive listing with better output formatting.\n\n**Note**: Code should be written without line breaks.\n\n### How to Run\n\n```bash\n# Standard format\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.read_text_file('./file.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### File Reading Tools\n\n#### `read_text_file(path, head=None, tail=None)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Read complete file contents\n- Read first N lines (head) or last N lines (tail)\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.read_text_file('./data/file.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `read_multiple_files(paths)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Read multiple files simultaneously\n- Use when reading a large number of files (e.g., multiple paper html pages)\n\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.read_multiple_files(['./a.txt', './b.txt'])\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### File Writing Tools\n\n#### `write_file(path, content)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Create new files\n- Overwrite existing files\n\n**⚠️ Warning**: Do NOT include triple backticks (` ``` `) in the content, as this will break command parsing.\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.write_file('./new.txt', 'Hello World')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `edit_file(path, edits)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Make line-based edits to existing files\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.edit_file('./file.txt', [{'oldText': 'foo', 'newText': 'bar'}])\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Directory Tools\n\n#### `create_directory(path)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Create new directories (supports recursive creation)\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.create_directory('./new/nested/dir')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `list_directory(path)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- List all files and directories in a path\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.list_directory('.')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `list_files(path=None, exclude_hidden=True)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- List only files in a directory\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.list_files('./data')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### File Operations\n\n#### `move_file(source, destination)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Move or rename files/directories\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.move_file('./old.txt', './new.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `search_files(pattern, base_path=None)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Search for files matching a glob pattern\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.search_files('*.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### File Information\n\n#### `get_file_info(path)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Get detailed metadata (size, created, modified, etc.)\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.get_file_info('./file.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `get_file_size(path)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Get file size in bytes\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.get_file_size('./file.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `get_file_ctime(path)` / `get_file_mtime(path)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Get file creation/modification time\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.get_file_mtime('./file.txt')\"\n```\n\n---\n\n#### `get_files_info_batch(filenames, base_path=None)`\n**Use Cases**:\n- Get file information for multiple files in parallel\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\npython run_fs_ops.py -c \"await fs.get_files_info_batch(['a.txt', 'b.txt'], './data')\"\n```\n\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the skill documentation above carefully\n2. Determine the appropriate command and parameters based on the user's task\n3. Output the command using the format specified in the system prompt (code block recommended)\n4. After receiving the results, provide a summary to the user\n\n**Remember:** You decide the command parameters based on the task requirements and the documentation above.\n",

This became the final solution.\n\n### **Clause 4.16 (Management Rights Letter)**\n- **Version 6, Michelle Jackson**: First raised the need for \"management rights for SBIC compliance\", initiating the discussion that led to the final requirement for a Management Rights Letter.\n\n### **Clause 6.8 (Legal Fees - $35,000 cap)**\n- **Version 7, Michelle Jackson**: First proposed \"$35,000 is reasonable compromise\" when negotiating between Bill Harvey's $25k and the initial $50k, which became the final amount.\n\n### **Clause 6.16 (Dispute Resolution - Arbitration)**\n- **Version 8, Tony Taylor**: First proposed \"arbitration for cost efficiency\" which became the final dispute resolution mechanism (arbitration in San Francisco).\n\nThe CSV file `tracing.csv` has been created in the main directory with the correct format showing the version numbers and names of the people who first proposed the ideas that led to the final solutions.",
