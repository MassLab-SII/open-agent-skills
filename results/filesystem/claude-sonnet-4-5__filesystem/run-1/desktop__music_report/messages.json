    "content": "\n\n## 🎯 Skill Activated: desktop-file-management\n\nThe 'desktop-file-management' skill has been activated. Below is the complete documentation.\n\n---\nname: desktop-file-management\ndescription: This skill provides tools for managing and analyzing desktop files. It includes music analysis reports, project organization, and timeline extraction. Use this when you need to organize scattered files, analyze data, or extract temporal information.\n---\n\n# Desktop File Management Skill\n\nThis skill provides tools for desktop file management and analysis:\n\n1. **Music analysis**: Generate popularity reports from music data\n2. **Project organization**: Structure project files into organized hierarchies\n3. **Timeline extraction**: Extract and organize temporal information from files\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Do not use other bash commands**: Do not attempt to use general bash commands or shell operations like cat, ls.\n\n\n## 1. Music Analysis Report\n\nAnalyzes music data from multiple artists, calculates popularity scores using a weighted formula, and generates a detailed analysis report.\n\n### Features\n\n- Reads song data from multiple artist directories\n- Supports CSV and TXT file formats\n- Calculates popularity scores using configurable weights:\n  - `popularity_score = (rating × W1) + (play_count_normalized × W2) + (year_factor × W3)`\n  - Default weights: W1=0.4, W2=0.4, W3=0.2\n- Sorts songs by popularity\n\n### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `--output` | `music_analysis_report.txt` | Output report filename |\n| `--rating-weight` | `0.4` | Weight for rating score |\n| `--play-count-weight` | `0.4` | Weight for normalized play count |\n| `--year-weight` | `0.2` | Weight for year factor |\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Generate music analysis report with default weights (0.4, 0.4, 0.2)\npython music_report.py /path/to/directory\n\n# Use a custom output filename\npython music_report.py /path/to/directory --output my_report.txt\n\n# Use custom weights for the popularity formula\npython music_report.py /path/to/directory --rating-weight 0.5 --play-count-weight 0.3 --year-weight 0.2\n```\n\n\n## 2. Project Organization\n\nOrganizes scattered project files into a structured directory hierarchy based on file types and content categories.\n\n### Features\n\n- Creates organized directory structure with 3 main categories\n- Moves Python files to `experiments/ml_projects/`\n- Moves CSV files to `experiments/data_analysis/`\n- Categorizes Markdown files by content:\n  - Learning-related → `learning/resources/`\n  - Entertainment-related → `personal/entertainment/`\n  - Collection-related → `personal/collections/`\n- Generates project structure documentation\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Organize projects (default output: organized_projects)\npython organize_projects.py /path/to/directory\n\n# Use a custom output directory name\npython organize_projects.py /path/to/directory --output-dir my_projects\n```\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\norganized_projects/\n├── experiments/\n│   ├── ml_projects/        # Python scripts\n│   └── data_analysis/      # CSV files\n├── learning/\n│   ├── progress_tracking/  # Placeholder\n│   └── resources/          # Learning docs\n└── personal/\n    ├── entertainment/      # Entertainment docs\n    └── collections/        # Collection docs\n```\n\n## 3. Timeline Extraction\n\nExtracts timeline information from files and generates a chronologically sorted timeline report.\n\n### Features\n\n- Recursively scans all files\n- Extracts dates in multiple formats:\n  - YYYY-MM-DD\n  - Month YYYY (uses 1st day)\n  - MM/DD/YYYY\n- Filters by specific year\n- Removes duplicate dates per file\n- Sorts chronologically\n- Generates timeline.txt report\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\n# Extract 2024 timeline (default)\npython extract_timeline.py /path/to/directory\n\n# Extract timeline for a specific year\npython extract_timeline.py /path/to/directory --year 2023\n\n# Use a custom output filename\npython extract_timeline.py /path/to/directory --output my_timeline.txt\n```\n\n### Output Format\n\nEach line: `file_path:YYYY-MM-DD`\n\n### Rules\n\n- If only month is shown, use the 1st day of that month\n- If only year is shown, skip it\n- If multiple tasks on same date in same file, count only once\n- Sort by chronological order\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the skill documentation above carefully\n2. Determine the appropriate command and parameters based on the user's task\n3. Output the command using the format specified in the system prompt (code block recommended)\n4. After receiving the results, provide a summary to the user\n\n**Remember:** You decide the command parameters based on the task requirements and the documentation above.\n",
